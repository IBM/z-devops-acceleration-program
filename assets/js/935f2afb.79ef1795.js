This package contains any artifact that will need to be deployed, for example, load modules, DBRMs, DDL, and the configuration files for the subsystems. Depending on the system, the package can be a WAR, EAR files, a Windows installer package, among others. The artifact repository can also be used as the publishing platform to store intermediate files needed in the build phase.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"build":{"id":"build","title":"Build","description":"The Build component of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline converts the source code into executable binaries. It supports multiple platforms and languages. In mainframe environments, it includes understanding dependencies, compile, link-edit, and unit test. The build can include the inspection of code quality to perform automated validation against a set of coding rules. In some cases, code quality inspection could also be a component of its own in the pipeline.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"dbb-migration-tool":{"id":"dbb-migration-tool","title":"DBB Migration Tool","description":"DBB Migration Tool overview","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"deployment-manager":{"id":"deployment-manager","title":"Deployment manager","description":"The deployment manager is responsible for understanding the execution environments and maintains an inventory of the environment\u2019s deployed content. It is used to rollout application packages. For many runtimes, copying artifacts is not enough to actually make them executable. There are numerous installation steps to perform.  A good example of this would be a CICS NEWCOPY/PHASE-IN, or, when DB2 is involved, a bind against the database of the environment.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"ibm-z-devops-solution":{"id":"ibm-z-devops-solution","title":"IBM Z DevOps solution","description":"What is IBM Z DevOps?","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"ide":{"id":"ide","title":"Integrated development environment","description":"An integrated development environment (IDE) provides check-out and check-in capabilities to the source code management (SCM) system. Typically, it supports the language and coding practices of the developer, enables building the modified code within the sandbox, and drives unit tests as part of the coding phase.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"install-configure":{"id":"install-configure","title":"Installing and configuring your tools","description":"Installation/set-up instructions and links to installation documentation for specific products. Git, DBB, and zAppBuild are required. Generally, most enterprises will pick one technology from each component category, although sometimes more than one IDE option is selected (depending on developer preference).","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"intro-cicd-zos":{"id":"intro-cicd-zos","title":"Introduction to CI/CD for z/OS","description":"Introduction to CI/CD","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"intro-migrating-data":{"id":"intro-migrating-data","title":"Introduction to migrating data","description":"Introduction to migrating data","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"journey-to-cicd":{"id":"journey-to-cicd","title":"Understanding the journey to a CI/CD pipeline","description":"What is involved in the migration effort from green screen to CI/CD?","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"managing-code-page-conversion":{"id":"managing-code-page-conversion","title":"Managing code page conversion","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"manual-migration":{"id":"manual-migration","title":"Manual migration","description":"Manual migration of source data from z/OS to Git is generally not recommended, as it tends to be slower, more tedious, and prone to human error.

The CI Orchestrator provides connectors to version control, build systems, and packaging and deployment. Its goal is to remove manual and repetitive tasks as much as possible. It also drives the building of the application package, includes automated unit tests, and publishes the results in an artifact repository to make them available to the provisioning and deployment practices.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"sclm-git-migration-tool":{"id":"sclm-git-migration-tool","title":"SCLM-to-Git Migration Tool","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"scm":{"id":"scm","title":"Source code management","description":"A source code management (SCM) tool manages and stores different versions of your application configuration such as source code files, application-specific configuration data, test cases, and more.

IBM Z Systems software trials (also known as IBM Z Trial) allows you try out a variety of IBM Z software experiences in a provisioned environment for free, meaning you can get right to learning the important points. The following IBM Z Trial experiences are particularly relevant to DevOps and CI/CD pipelines for z/OS applications:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
