This is when the "plumbing" work for the pipeline begins, integrating the different CI/CD components together in the context of your selected technologies (for example: pipeline orchestrator, Git provider, deployment manager, and so on). In this milestone, it is also important to communicate the DevOps transformation journey to the intended users of the new CI/CD pipeline.
