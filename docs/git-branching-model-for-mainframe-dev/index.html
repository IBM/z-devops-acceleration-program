Developers work in isolation in feature branches to implement changes to the source code, and ideally test the changes in a specific environment. Each feature branch (sometimes referred to as a &quot;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#_topic_branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">topic branch</a>&quot;) is dedicated to a specific developer task such as a feature or bug fix.</p><p>This approach can be compared to a trunk-based branching model that leverages feature branches. A similar workflow is also documented by Microsoft without giving it a name.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></p><p>The <code>main</code> branch is the point of reference for the entire history of the mainline changes to the code base, and should be a protected branch. All changes should originate on a separate branch created to hold them until they are ready to be merged. Using a branch-and-merge approach is natural in a Git-based development workflow, and is very lightweight both in terms of resource consumption and developer experience.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Start simple" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/start-simple-84a29259ccc040ea16ffe5b7bf23705d.png" width="977" height="279" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="all-changes-start-on-a-dedicated-branch">All changes start on a dedicated branch<a href="#all-changes-start-on-a-dedicated-branch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to All changes start on a dedicated branch" title="Direct link to All changes start on a dedicated branch">​</a></h4><p>Although all Git-based DevOps services provide direct access to the server copy of the code repository, developers will typically use an integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice to work locally on a clone of the repository. Standard practices ensure developers&#x27; local clones are synchronized with the server copy (typically known as the &quot;remote&quot;) through actions known as &quot;pull&quot; and &quot;push&quot;. (For those unfamiliar with Git terminology, these terms are explained in finer detail in <a href="/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/scm#git-basics">Source code management</a>.)</p><p>In a small team where there is almost never more than one change in progress at a time, using a branch enables the developer to make the changes in a series of commits rather than as one atomic change as they edit source and save files. Of course, the &quot;one-line&quot; change might mean there genuinely is only one commit that needs merging, but the process is so natural and light-weight that it is not worth making that a special case.</p><p>Such branches are able to be built prior to merging - this can eliminate the possibility of the merge breaking the build of <code>main</code>, thus reducing the risk in making changes.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Diagram of a feature branch pipeline" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/start-simple-feature-branch-buildable-f01dd2ff0324c33bfdd886bb138846a0.png" width="684" height="279" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="merging-a-branch">Merging a branch<a href="#merging-a-branch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Merging a branch" title="Direct link to Merging a branch">​</a></h4><p>A branch holds all the commits for a change - be that a single commit for a one-liner or a sequence of commits as the developer refined the change while making it ready for review and merging into <code>main</code>.</p><p>The request to merge a branch is made explicitly, but can be as formal or informal as needed by the team. Protection of <code>main</code> can mean that only certain people can perform the merge, or that a review and approval of the change is required before merging it, or both.</p><p>The action of merging can either simply take all the commits from the branch and add them to <code>main</code>, or that multiple commits in the branch can be &quot;<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#_squashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">squashed</a>&quot; into one commit - the latter can keep the overall history on <code>main</code> &quot;cleaner&quot; if that&#x27;s important to the team.</p><p><code>main</code> should always build successfully, enabling the team to choose when to package and deploy.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scaling-up">Scaling up<a href="#scaling-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scaling up" title="Direct link to Scaling up">​</a></h3><p>The use of branches for concurrently planned activities scales extremely well for busier teams. Additionally, <a href="https://scaledagileframework.com/epic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic</a> and release maintenance branches accommodate specific development workflows and allow the model to scale even further. The latter two branches exist for the duration of the epic or release maintenance and are short-living branches.</p><p>The implemented changes of the iteration are then delivered collectively as part of the next release. Each development team decides how long an iteration is. We advocate for working towards smaller, quicker release cycles, but this model can also be used with longer iterations. Due to business or technical reasons, the merging of features into the <code>main</code> branch can also be delayed. Although this scenario is a discouraged practice, the recommendation in this case is to group such features into a specific epic branch, as described later.</p><p>This branching model leverages Git tags to identify the various configurations/versions of the application, such as a release candidate or the version of the application repository that is deployed to production.</p><p>Depending on the type of change, the development workflow can vary. In the standard scenario, developers use the <code>main</code> branch to deliver changes for the next planned release, while the release maintenance branches allow fixing of the current release running in the production runtime environment(s). Using epic branches is optional for development teams, but is a grouping mechanism for multiple features that should be built and tested together, thus allowing teams to increase the concurrency of working on multiple, larger development initiatives of the application. The epic branch also represents a way to manage the lifecycle of features that are not planned for the next planned release. In this way, it is a vehicle to delay merging the set of features into the <code>main</code> branch for a later time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="supported development workflows" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/scale-up-d67bdbbbfb81dda1b9a0e13ef14f61c8.png" width="1119" height="761" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The <code>main</code>, epic, and release branches are assumed to be protected branches, meaning that no developer can directly push changes to these configurations. It requires developers to make changes on a feature branch and go through the pull request process. Before merging the feature branch into a shared branch (whether it is the <code>main</code> branch or an epic branch), some evidence should be gathered to ensure quality and respect of the coding standards in the enterprise. Peer-reviewed code, a clean pipeline execution, and approvals are examples of such evidence, allowing the development team to confidently merge the feature branch into the target branch. In a continuous integration workflow, integrations are expected to happen early to avoid delaying merge conflicts or merges leading to an unstable build.</p><p>Notice that <code>main</code> is the only long-running branch. In particular, there are no branches aligned to environments which may be deployed to - such as <code>prod</code>, <code>production</code>, <code>QA</code> or <code>Test</code> branches.
We would expect builds to be
deployed to environments known by similar names, but there is no compelling reason to have such branches. The build and deployment tools ensure clear
traceability from the point in the history of <code>main</code> (or a feature/epic branch before merging) a package was produced. The deployment manager installs the package into the various testing environments and,
upon successful completion of testing and sign-off, into the production environment as a release.
The deployment manager maintains the inventories of the deployed packages for the various
runtime environments.</p><p>Additional long-lived branches will each
represent alternative <em>histories</em> and give rise to possible ambiguity as sequences of commits
that will need to be merged to multiple branches
rather than just to <code>main</code>.</p><p>The single consolidated history on <code>main</code> serializes the commits of merged feature or fix branches - and then is punctuated with explicit release
tags and/or release branches. Since a branch can be easily created from any previous commit even if a
release candidate build needs a specific fix this can be achieved whenever it is needed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="naming-conventions">Naming conventions<a href="#naming-conventions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Naming conventions" title="Direct link to Naming conventions">​</a></h3><p>Consistent branch naming conventions help indicate the context for the work that is performed. Throughout this document, the following naming patterns are used:</p><ul><li><p><code>main</code>: The only long-living branch which is the only branch from which every release is initially derived</p></li><li><p><code>release/rel-2.0.1</code>: The release maintenance branch for an example release named rel-2.0.1</p></li><li><p><code>epic/ai-fraud-detection</code>: An epic branch where &quot;aiFraudDetection&quot; is describing the initiative context (in this example, an initiative to adopt AI technology for fraud detection)</p></li></ul><p>Feature branches also need to relate back to the change request (or issue) from the planning phase and their context. Some examples are shown in the following list:</p><ul><li><p><code>feature/new-mortgage-calculation</code> for a planned feature for the next planned release</p></li><li><p><code>hotfix/rel-2.0.1/fix-mortgage-calculation</code> for a fix of the current production version that is running the rel-2.0.1 release</p></li><li><p><code>ai-fraud-detection/introduce-ai-model-to-mortgage-calculation</code> for a contribution to the development initiative for adopting AI technology for fraud detection.</p></li></ul><p>A common, recommended practice is to squash the different commits created on the feature branch into a single new commit when merging, which keeps the Git history from becoming cluttered with intermediate work for the feature. This also helps to maintain a tidy history on the <code>main</code> branch with only the important commits.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integration-branches">Integration branches<a href="#integration-branches" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integration branches" title="Direct link to Integration branches">​</a></h3><p>Specific branches, such as <code>main</code>, epic, and release branches can be seen as integration branches, because their purpose is to integrate changes from other branches (typically feature branches). To drive the integration process of changes into a shared branch of code, mechanisms like pull requests are a convenient way as they guide the developers with a streamlined workflow. The number of integration branches required for your development process depends on the needs of the application team. However, while the cost of creating new branches is low, keeping them up-to-date, for instance by integrating release bugfixes from the stabilization phase into concurrent epic branches, can be expensive.</p><p>For application teams who want to embrace an agile development methodology and who sequentially deliver new releases with limited parallel development initiatives, they can use the <code>main</code> branch and, optionally, the release maintenance branch as integration branches to implement the next planned release and potential bug fixes. The following diagram illustrates a branching model for a Git-based development process with sequential release deliveries.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Branching diagram showing Git-based development process with sequential release deliveries" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/image2-e0e3cc8261d1bfabbbbb64680921da85.png" width="839" height="655" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If the development teams need to work on a significant development initiative in parallel to the standard scenario of the next planned release, this model allows isolation using the epic branch workflow. The epic branch (<code>epic_1</code>) in the following branching diagram represents an additional integration branch that is used to implement, build, and test multiple features that are planned for the development initiative and can be merged into the <code>main</code> branch at a later time. The team decides which commit/tag of the codebase in the <code>main</code> branch will be used as the base for the epic branch, although it is recommended to start from the last tag for the <code>main</code> branch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Branching diagram showing Git-based development process with an epic branch for a larger development solution initiative" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/image3-9ff490e7d8b4717c1aa77998d0e09635.png" width="1210" height="980" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When the work items implemented on the epic branch are planned and ready to be delivered as part of the next planned release, the development team merges the epic branch into the <code>main</code> branch.</p><p>Epic branches can be used to compose various styles of development processes.

The development team is responsible for coordinating if features are required to be implemented in a specific order.</p></li><li><p>For each work item, a feature branch is created according to pre-defined naming conventions, allowing the assigned developers to have a copy of the codebase on which they can work in isolation from other concurrent development activities.</p><p><img

While developing on the feature branch, a common practice is for developers to regularly sync their feature branch with the <code>main</code> branch by merging the latest changes from the <code>main</code> branch into their feature branch. This ensures that developers are operating based on a recent state of <code>main</code>, and helps to identify any potential merge conflicts so that they can resolve them in their feature branch.</p></div></div></li><li><p>Developers test their changes before requesting to integrate them into the shared codebase. For example, they can test the build outputs of the User Build step. For a more integrated experience, the CI/CD pipeline orchestrator can be configured to run a pipeline for the feature branch on the central Git server each time the developers push their committed changes to it. This process will start a consolidated build that includes the changed and impacted programs within the application scope. Unit tests can be automated for this pipeline, as well. To continue even further testing the feature branch, the developer might want to validate the build results in a controlled test environment, which is made possible by an optional process to create a <a href="/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#package-and-deploy-a-feature-for-testing-in-controlled-test-environments">preliminary package for the feature branch</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Diagram of Feature Branch Pipelines" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/defaultWorkflow_featureBranchPipeline-323090bbd6bc481b6074eb0ed48f4ec0.png" width="678" height="284" class="img_ev3q"></p></li><li><p>When developers feel their code changes are ready to be integrated back into the shared <code>main</code> branch, they create a pull request asking to integrate the changes from their feature branch into the <code>main</code> branch. The pull request process provides the capability to add peer review and approval steps before allowing the changes to be merged. As a basic best practice, the changes must be buildable. If the pull request is associated with a feature branch pipeline, this pipeline can also run automated builds of the code in the pull request along with tests and code quality scans.</p></li><li><p>Once the pull request is merged into the <code>main</code> branch, the next execution of the <a href="/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#the-basic-build-pipeline-for-main-epic-and-release-branches">Basic Build Pipeline</a> will build all the changes (and their impacts) of the iteration based on the <code>main</code> branch.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Branching diagram showing the Basic Build Pipeline execution after the feature branch&amp;#39;s pull request is merged into the main branch" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/defaultWorkflow_buildPipelineAfterMerge-f4b4c0cafc3bfa64c830ec4237f18536.png" width="678" height="247" class="img_ev3q">  </p><p>The pipeline can optionally include a stage to deploy the built artifacts (load modules, DBRMs, and so on) into a shared test environment, as highlighted by the blue DEV-TEST icon in the above diagram. In this DEV-TEST environment, the development team can validate their combined changes. This first test environment helps support a shift-left testing strategy by providing a sandbox with the necessary setup and materials for developers to test their changes early. The installation happens through the packaging and deployment process of a preliminary package that cannot be installed to higher environments (because it is compiled with test options), or alternatively through a simplified script solution performing a copy operation. In the latter, no inventory and no deployment history of the DEV-TEST system exist.</p></li><li><p>In the example scenario for this workflow, the development team decides after implementing Feature 1 and Feature 2 to progress further in the delivery process and build a release candidate package based on the current state of the <code>main</code> branch. With this decision, the development team manually runs the <a href="/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#the-release-pipeline-with-build-package-and-deploy-stages">Release Pipeline</a>. This pipeline rebuilds the contributed changes for this iteration - with the compiler options to produce executables optimized for performance rather than for debug. The pipeline includes an additional stage to package the build outputs and create a release candidate package (Package RC1 in the following diagram), which is stored in a binary artifact repository.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Diagram of the Release Pipeline building the changes for the iteration and packaging build outputs into a release candidate package" src="/z-devops-acceleration-program/assets/images/defaultWorkflow_releasePipeline_RC1-d5006d46c06f1dd7d330a235932d63c4.png" width="674" height="285" class="img_ev3q"></p><p> Although not depicted in the above diagram, this point in <code>main</code>&#x27;s history can be tagged to identify it as a release candidate.</p></li><li><p>The release candidate package is installed in the various test stages and takes a predefined route. The process can be assisted by the pipeline orchestrator itself, or the development team can use the deployment manager. In the event of a defect being found in the new code of the release candidate package, the developer creates a feature branch from the <code>main</code> branch, corrects the issue, and merges it back into the <code>main</code> branch (while still following the normal pull request process). It is expected that the new release candidate package with the fix is required to pass all the quality gates and to be tested again.</p></li><li><p>In this sample walkthrough of an iteration, the development of the third work item (Feature 3) is started later. The same steps as above apply for the developer of this work item.

For each of these scenarios, the development team is using an epic branch to keep the changes in multiple features separated from the other development activities. It is an integration branch to group and integrate multiple features that are planned for this initiative.
